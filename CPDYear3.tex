\section{Introduction} (169)
Last year has been a disaster for me, however, I'm very happy I've been invited to this team. The team is extremely nice and positive about the game and it's potential. I can feel that we make a strong connection with each other. We can easily talk about the game, future ideas, mechanics and just have a chat to get to know each other better. However, there's never only a positive outcome in interacting with other people. There will always be some conflicts and misunderstandings, which will impact our production in the future. Luckily, it has not been yet as crucial to this point, but I feel like the temptation is growing in all of us bit by bit. This has to be handled as soon as possible to prevent big losses for the whole team. That's what I will be trying to plan in this report - criticizing myself and my team for the good and looking for solutions for particular problems that may occur in the second semester.

\section{Prioritizing work} (195)
Most of my time in the studio I've been working on our main prototype - a real-time strategy (RTS) game. Implementing basic mechanics, features. However, I've been doing that selfishly - without prioritizing my tasks in regards to minimal viable product (MVP). I was working on whatever I thought could be used in the game without asking our designers or looking into the design documents they made. This did not turn out overwhelmingly terrible, however, I still lost some time working on unnecessary stuff that has not been considered yet. By this point, we could've had enough content for our MVP and start expanding by adding new features or mechanics, so that the game doesn't fill empty. This was my omission and I would want to avoid that in the next semester as well as this semester by communicating closely with designers and looking more in-depth into their design documents to get a better grip on what is expected to be done during sprints. This will help prioritize the features and mechanics of the game and get important things done quicker due to better insight of its importance and better knowledge of the detail of the task.
