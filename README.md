# CPD Year 2 Term 2

## Week 1
Back from summer holidays and ready to work. Am feeling much better regarding team game project.

This week we have been introduced to our new assignments and I feel a bit lost about COMP260 distributed systems, 
because I'm not sure about the details of these systems, but the idea of making a MUD game is interesting nevertheless.

However, for AI module, I have no idea what I can do. I did have an idea before what tool I really want to make, but 
I'm not 100% sure I can do that.

## Week 2
I have eventually decided to make an AI tool I wanted some time ago. It's a tool for Unity where desginers can easily 
make an AI agent given different scripts and adding them into a list. It's a utility-based AI, so behaviours are executed 
depending on the score. Behaviour's which has the highest score is going to be executed and these scored are calculated 
within those scripts. The main one is just telling which on to execute. It has to be a designer-friendly tool, which is also 
an easy and very fast in making unique agents.

Regarding COMP260, I barely understand anything about socketing. It's like a dark forest for me. During lectures, I somewhat 
understand it, but when it gets to implementing it, I hardly know what does what. Hope it will get clearer for me when 
we start implementing more stuff into our MUDs.
