## Key skills

### Affective domain (managing emotions and mental states - 151)
While I'm personally am stable with my emotions and mental states at most times, the ability to describe these mental states during both individual and team projects is very important. In such case, one can better understand himself and therefore find out whether these mental states can influence the overall outcome of a project or workflow. However, describing these states can be very difficult for me due to the little knowledge and understanding of my own emotions.

Nevertheless, it can be an important skill I could develop for myself - to try and describe my mental states and emotions during the development processes I take part at. In which case, if I find negative influence during some states of mine, I could immediately fight it myself if it's something light-weighted or look for help if necessary.

#### Action

Equally balancing my work between all the assignment and personal time is extremely hard for me.
